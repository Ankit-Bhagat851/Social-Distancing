# Social-Distancing
We will go through in detail how one can use python combined with deep learning and computer vision to monitor social distancing.
The real-time object detection algorithms which use the CNN model such as Region-Based Convolutional Neural Networks (R-CNN) and You Only Look Once (YOLO) are developed for the detection of multiple classes in various regions.
